# Data-exploration-and-cleaning-with-pyspark
##### PySpark is the Python API for Apache Spark, an open-source, distributed computing system that provides an interface for programming entire clusters with implicit data parallelism and fault tolerance. Developed by the Apache Software Foundation, Spark offers a fast and general-purpose engine for large-scale data processing. PySpark allows users to harness the power of Spark using Python, making it accessible to a broad range of data scientists and engineers.

### Case Study For Nuga Bank

### EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
##### Nuga Bank, a leading financial institution, undertook a strategic initiative to enhance its data exploration and cleaning processes using PySpark. This case study explores the project, detailing how Nuga Bank utilized PySpark to streamline data preparation, which facilitated better insights and improved decision-making.

### BUSINESS PROBLEM STATEMENT

##### Nuga Bank faced challenges in effectively exploring and cleaning vast volumes of financial data, hindering its ability to derive actionable insights.Data engineers were tasked with addressing the following key issues:
1. Inefficient manual data exploration and cleaning processes.
2.Lack of scalability to handle growing data volumes.
3.Inconsistent data quality leading to inaccurate reporting and analysis.
4.Complexity in transforming raw data into a structured and normalized database format.

### Objectives

##### The primary objectives for data engineers were to:

1. Implement an automated data exploration and cleaning solution using PySpark to streamline the process.
2. Normalize the dataset into a suitable database format (2NF or 3NF) for
3. improved data integrity and consistency.
4. Load the cleaned and normalized dataset into a PostgreSQL server for further analysis and reporting.



### Benefits
The implementation of the PySpark data exploration and cleaning solution resulted in the following benefits for data engineers:
